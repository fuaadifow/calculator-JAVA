For this project I will create a Calculator class and add some basic functionality
to it. The Basic Calculator is able to evaluate simple arithmetical expressions involving integer
operands and the operators: * , / , + , -.
The functionality of the basic calculator is as follows.
1. Evaluating simple arithmetical expressions
2. The calculator can evaluate expressions of the following form: operand[space]operator[space]operand
For example, 3 + 4, 2 * 10, 10 / 5, 39 - 47.
3. Thus, the operands are any valid integer and the operator is one of * , / , + or -. There is a
space character between each operand and the operator.
4. For the Basic Calculator, if the user enters an expression (as a String) that is not precisely of
the form shown above then the program should return a boolean value.
5. If the user enters an expression involving a ‘divide-by-zero’ error then the program should
also output a boolean value in that case too.
